# Impact of Covid-19 on NYC Subway System 

In this project we explore the demand of subway systems in large metropolitan areas during epidemics and determine how much a virus contributes to teh demand for the subway system, how to respond to a changing demand, adn predict the best way to alter the subway system in order to reduce transmission amongst passengers. 
We were primarily focused on studying the effects of COVID-19 on the New York City subway system.
